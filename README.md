# ORENGEO POS LIVE DEMO

This is the live demo that I've done previously in Orengeo team. The demo itself is driven by local dummy data but not connect to any backend service. Just give you the look and feel of this app and the taste of UI/UX.

## Disclaimer

I am no longer working for Orengeo team since 2014. This demo is only for display purpose in my portfolio and doesn't relate to Orengeo Inc. (Sadly, the company seems like discontinued sometime last year.)
